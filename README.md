This file is created to explain zellers law to find day of any date in any year.
With this technique named after its founder Zeller, you can solve any ‘Dates and Calendars’ problems. Zeller’s Rule can be used to find the day on any particular date in the calendar in the history. All you have to know is the formula given below and how to use it.

Zeller’s Rule Formula

F = K + [(13xM – 1)/5] + D + [D/4] + [C/4] – 2C

where,
1) K = Date. So, for 06/08/1990, we take K=06

In Zellers rule, months start from March.

2) M = Month no.

Remember that month Starts from March in this formula. So,…

March = 1,

April = 2,

May = 3

and so on… till

Dec = 10,

Jan = 11

Feb. = 12

So, for 06/08/1990, M=6

3) D = Last two digits of the year

So, in our example of 6/08/1990 D=90

Also remember that when you have to find day of the first or second month of any year, then Year=Given year-1
i.e. When you want to find Day of 15-2-1990.,
K=15,
Month=12,
D=Given Year-1=1990-1=1989=89 [Thanks Vineet for the Correction]

4) C = The first two digits of century

So, in our example of 06/08/1990.. C = 19.

Let us now calculate the day for 06/08/1990 with the formula above. Remember that the values of K, M, D and C are 06, 06, 90 and 19 respectively.

The formula is F = K + [(13xM – 1)/5] + D + [D/4] + [C/4] – 2C

Replacing the values in the formula, we get

F = 06 + [{(13 x 6)- 1}/5] + 90 + 90/4 + 19/4 – (2 x 19)

Therefore,

F = 06 + 77/5 + 90 + 90/4 + 19/4 – 38

Which gives..

F =06 + 15.4 + 90 + 22.5 + 4.75 – 38

[ We have to Consider only the integral value and ignore the value after decimal. So, the equation changes a bit as shown below. We have just removed value after decimal ]

F =06 + 15 + 90 + 22 + 4 – 38

Therefore, F = 99

Now that you have a numerical value for the day, divide the number by 7. We need the remainder only. For example, in this case, the remainder is 1.

Now, match the remainder with the chart below:

1 = Monday
2 = Tuesday
3 = Wednesday
4 = Thursday
5 = Friday
6 = Saturday
7 = Sunday

Here, 1 represents Monday.
